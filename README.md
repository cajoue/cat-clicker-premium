Javascript application for cat clicker game

Based on [Cat Clicker Duel](https://github.com/cajoue/cat-clicker-duel) 

** Requirements for Cat Clicker Premium **

_Visuals_

* The application should display
    - a list of at least 5 cats, listed by name
    - an area to display the selected cat
* In the cat display area, the following should be displayed
    - the cat's name
    - a picture of the cat
    - text showing the number of clicks

The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.

_Interaction_

* When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
* The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.

**To Do:**
* <del>create at least 5 cats</del>
* create cat list for menu
* create cat display area - arena

**Thoughts/Mods**
* create a Cat class - need some clarity!
* <del>create cat containers for cat menu and cat arena</del>
